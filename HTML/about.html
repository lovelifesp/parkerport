<h3>Get to know me a little more</h3>

</div>

<P>
After spending nine years working in Retail&Fashion
six of those years spent in management. I find myself
making a career change into Front-End Web Development.
<div>
My introduction to "coding" was one of chance and a ambition to fill a
need at my then job. In 2014 my father told me about a program that google had to teach
women how to code, but the deadline had already passed by the time I was made aware of it. Also at that same time in 2014 I was
working for a womens clothing commpany in Birmingham, MI and we desperately needed our website
updated from it's 2006 glory days. I had my light bulb moment and after days and nights of doing research on coding, I found a
intro HTML & CSS two night workshop with Girl Develop IT. I signed one week later
 with the hopes of being able to learn a new skill, add to my value at work and save our website
all at the same time. I've also found code as another way to create and be creative.
</div>
</P>
<h3>Bright Ideas</h3>

<p>
After taking the workshop and laughing at how I
naively believed I would be able to rebulid or edit our current
website after two days. I started to think of how I could merge my love of clothing and retail
with this new passion to learn to code. From there I thought of all the possibilities
that come along with learning how to read and write code and being exposed to all the
ways we interact with some form of code in our daily lives. I recieved a suggestion from Girl Develop IT about Grand Circus Detroit.
Shortly after I went home and did more research about bootcamps and Grand Circus, I was drawn in even more. I took the opportunity to attend
a open house; I applied, interviewed,and was accepeted into the Front-End bootcamp. In between that time of acceptance and the start of
the bootcamp I attended as many workshops, panel discussions,
and tech talks as possible.
 </p>
 <h4> Idea To Reality </h4>
<p>
I am currently a student in the January Front-End bootcamp
and it is exciting to start this new journey. My goal is to
become a great developer and <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/"> build sites for trendy
companies like Refinery29</a>
